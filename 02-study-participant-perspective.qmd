## Changes in legal contexts

::: incremental
-   EU secures right to own data in Art. 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/))
    -   “*The data subject shall have \[...\] access to the personal data*” (§ Art. 15, 1)
    -   “*The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data*” (§ Art. 15, 3)
-   According to § Art. 20, users must receive their data "*in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format*" (§ Art. 20, 1)

👉 **Solution:** Platforms offer data download packages (DDPs), which users can request and download to inspect data.

👉 **Consequence**: Researchers uses DDPs as part of user-centric data donation studies.

Please raise your hand ✋ if you...

*1) knew about this right?*

*2) ever tried to request your data?*

## What are data donation studies?

**Definition** 💡: Data donation studies are a **user-centric**, **privacy-by-design** method for collecting digital traces:

::: incremental
-   Users have the right to request, access, and download data that platforms collect about them.
-   They can make their *data packages (DDPs)* available to science via *data donation tools (DDTs)*, often in the context of surveys.
-   Researchers use CSS methods to filter, anonymize, and aggregate this data **locally** on participants' devices.
-   Participants can inspect/delete their data before any data is transferred.
:::

## Which types of data do DDPs contain?

For platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, for example... [@hase_etal2024]

::: incremental
-   *User profiles* (e.g., privacy settings)
-   *Activities* (e.g., friends, likes, searches, exposure, analog movements)
-   *Content and context* (e.g., ads watched, algorithmically inferred interests)
:::

## How is data from DDPs different?

Compared to **APIs** [@stollfus_computational_2023; @ohme_digital_2024]...

-   Control & informed consent of users
-   Longitudinal data without “rate limits”
-   Partly more knowledge about missing data (e.g., unit drop-out)
-   Partly additional measurements (e.g., exposure data; non-public data)

## How is data from DDPs different?

Compared to **tracking** [@stollfus_computational_2023; @ohme_digital_2024]...

-   Retrospective & often more longitudinal
-   Partly additional measurements (e.g., algorithmic inferences)
-   Anchored in current provisions in law [for issues with tracking, see @edelson_facebook_2021]

👉 but similarly burdensome for participants!

## Summary: What are data donation studies? 📚 {.normal-cite-slide}

-   **Summary**: User-centric method for collecting digital traces: Users download their data packages (DDPs) from platforms and make them available to science via data donation tools (DDTs).

## 2) Participant perspective

::: notes
-   As data donation is really centered on the participant, we best start to understand data donation by taking their perspective.
-   You already did one part of this process before coming here: Requesting and downloading your data from YouTube, Instagram, or LinkedIn

*How easy (or hard) did you find it to request your data? Did you encounter any obstacles?* 🤔
:::

## Step I: Data request

Different degrees in standardization for data requests [@hase_etal2024]...

-   Verification procedure
-   Specification of data (metrics, observation period)
-   Notification on provision of DDP
-   Duration of DDP availability

## Step II: Download

**📢 Task 1: Inspect your DDPs.**

1.  *Which variables can you identify?*
2.  *How could you use these for research in your field?*
3.  *What are questions you may have about these measurements?*

Feel free to work in groups of 2-3 people (around 15 minutes)

## Step II: Download

Different degrees in standardization for DDP content [@hase_etal2024]...

**Documentation & changes over time**

-   What does each file "mean"?
-   How was this data measured?

**Completeness & scope**

-   Is data missing and, if so, why?
-   Why are some data points limited to specific time frames?
-   How do we handle multi-lingual DDPs?

**📢 Task 2: Try donating your data.**

*Upload and inspect your data. If you could not download the data, use the ZIP folder "example data" (see landing page) for this session.*

1)  Are there any surprising/missing values?
2)  Did you encounter any difficulties in deleting/sharing your data?

**📢 Task 3: Extract personality profiles from data.**

*Inspect the ZIP folder "example" data for this session (manually or upload it to the data donation study - data you see may then differ). Imagine you are a commercial company.* 

*Based on the trace data, how would you profile this person in terms of....*

1)  sociodemographic characteristics
2)  their interests
3)  ads you may target them with

## Bias in Data Donation Studies

Similar to tracking studies, data donation characterized by [@keusch_etal2024; @hase_etal2024; @hase_haim2024a]:

-   Errors in representation (e.g., coverage error, non-response error)
-   Measurement errors (e.g., missing data, specification error)

👉 Not necessarily less biased than survey data - but subject to different bias?

👉 We will talk about this in Session 4️⃣.

## Informed Consent in Data Donation Studies

Similar to tracking [@kreuter_etal2020a]: Is consent really "informed"? [@groot_kormelink_meaningful_2025; @hase_haim2024a]

![](images/meme_consent.jpg){fig-alt="Meme on why informed consent is hard and participants often confused" fig-align="left"}

## Informed Consent in Data Donation Studies

Similar to tracking [@kreuter_etal2020a]: Is consent really "informed"? [@groot_kormelink_meaningful_2025; @hase_haim2024a]

-   in walk-through interviews, participants "*fundamentally misunderstood [this] key principle*" (p. 8)
-   Anecdotal evidence: sending data via email, sending different data, sending someone else's data, etc.
-   Almost no one deletes data (except for searches!)

## Summary: Participant perspective 📚 {.normal-cite-slide}

-   **Summary**: Key steps from the participant perspective ...

    1.  Data request
    2.  Data download
    3.  Data donation
