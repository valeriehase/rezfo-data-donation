## How do we communicate in this workshop?

My goal is that you...

-   just <b>ask right away</b> if there is something you did not understand
-   keep in mind that there <b>are not stupid questions</b>
-   feel free to ask questions specific to your potential data donation projects!

## What is digital trace data?

**Definition** 💡: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

-   e.g., tweets, likes, shares on social media
-   e.g., geo data (locations, movements)
-   e.g., digital payments
-   e.g., Spotify playlists

## What is digital trace data?

**Definition** 💡: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

-   e.g., tweets, **likes**, shares on social media

**Example: Instagram Like**

## Which systems/sensors collect traces?

-   Apps & social media platforms (e.g., Instagram)
-   Payment systems (e.g., Paypal)
-   Wearable devices (e.g., smart watch, fitbit)
-   Governmental databases (e.g., health data)

## Which types of data does this include?

Depending on the data collection method... [@stollfus_computational_2023; @ohme_digital_2024]:

-   often fine-grained (e.g., time-stamped)
-   often longitudinal (e.g., over years, within-individual change)
-   often less reactive (e.g., less concerns about social desirability)

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)

“How many minutes a day do you use the internet to consume news?”

::: incremental
-   „internet"?
-   „news"?
-   „how many minutes"?
:::

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   **Problems with self-reported data** (e.g., via survey)
    -   Inaccurate measurements (recall issues)
    -   Bias [@scharkow_accuracy_2016; @parry_etal2021]: individual characteristics may predict under- or overreporting
    -   Declining response rates in surveys [@luiten_survey_2020]

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   **Problems with self-reported data** (e.g., via survey)
-   **Availability of digital traces**
    -   cheap (e.g., via APIs)
    -   large data sets ("big data")
    -   more accurate ("objective data")

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)
-   Availability of digital traces

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)
-   Availability of digital traces

**Be careful**: These "advantages" of traces are often claimed, but **empirically disputed**.

Digital traces are **neither** necessarily less biased, nor cheaper, or larger (we will discuss this in Session 4️⃣).

## (Dis-)advantages of digital trace data

-   ✅ More fine-grained, often longitudinal measures due to timestamps
-   ✅ Partly measurement of new variables (e.g., algorithmic inference)
-   ❌ Still bias due to errors in representation and measurement
-   ❌ Implementation can be expensive and cumbersome

Which methods do you know/have you used for collecting digital trace data*?* 🤔
:::

![](images/meme_promise.jpg){fig-alt="the promise of data donation using a toy story meme" fig-align="left"}

## Platform- and user-centric methods

::: incremental
-   **Platform-centric** (based on platform cooperation)
    -   API [@engel_brief_2021]
    -   Cooperation with platforms [@wagner_etal2023]
-   **User-centric** (based on user cooperation and informed consent) or "follow the user" approaches [@caliandro_2024]
    -   Data donation [@carriere_etal2024]
    -   Linkage to existing databases [@sloan_etal2020]
    -   Active sharing via sensors [@struminskaya_etal2021]

:::

## Platform- and user-centric methods

![](images/method-comparison.png){fig-alt="comparing different methods across legal and measurement considerations" fig-align="left" width="300"}

## Platform- and user-centric methods

<div>

-   **Restrictions of platform-centric methods**
    -   Discontinuation of APIs [@freelon_2018]
    -   Concerns about bias [@schatto-eckrodt_2022; @ulloa_etal2025]
-   **User-centric methods become more popular, given ...**
    -   Legal frameworks enabling such studies (GDPR, DSA)
    -   Presumably (!) more researcher control
    -   Ethical considerations (informed consent)

</div>

## Summary: How can we collect digital traces? 📚 {.normal-cite-slide}

-   **Summary**

    -   Platform-centric methods (e.g., APIs) and user-centric methods (e.g., data donation)

    -   Key differences: control over samples & measurements, legal & ethical contexts

-   **Further literature**
